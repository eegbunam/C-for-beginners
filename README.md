# CIS 2542
## Intro CS/ Data Structures

- This is a compilation of homework(Assigments) and coding assigments(CD) done for one of my classes at the collage of dupage. No documentation here but if you are researching me for some reason and you want to see what I whipped up in college, feel free to take a look. At this time of doing thiese assigments none of these assigment took more than an hour to complete. However the coding assigments are a different beast - still tameable ofcourse. The coding assigments took up to 3 hours but it was mostly very straight foward.
- This class really taught me about C++ and its syntax. I learned alot about pointers, smart pointers and etc that
